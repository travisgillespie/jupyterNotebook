    "The purpose of this project is to explore a dataset with Tableau and create an explanatory data visualisation that clearly communicates my findings. The flight delays data for this project comes from a Kaggle dataset (#resources), which tracks performance of on-time US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. The data can be downloaded from Kaggle [<sup>1</sup>](#resources), or found in _data.zip_. The flight delays data set was used to create the following [Tableau story](https://public.tableau.com/views/flight_delays/Story1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes):\n",
