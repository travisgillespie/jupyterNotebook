Read the file _predicting_diamond_prices_Report.pdf_. I haven't figured out how to get Jupyter Notebook to download my reports as pdf while maintaining the anchor links embedded in markdown. The links show up as a question mark with a border. Any suggestions you may have will be appreciated.

I also created an html version which maintains the color and looks a bit cleaner. But, my preferred method is opening the .ipynb file itself.
