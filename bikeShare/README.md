# Project Overview

This project allowed me to perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. I compared the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. I also looked at differences within each system for users that are _registered – regular users_, and users that are _short-term – casual users_.
