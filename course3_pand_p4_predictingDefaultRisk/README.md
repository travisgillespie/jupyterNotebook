# Currently working on this project.
You work for a small bank and are responsible for determining if customers are creditworthy to give a loan to. Your team typically gets 200 loan applications per week and approves them by hand.

Due to a financial scandal that hit a competitive bank last week, you suddenly have an influx of new people applying for loans for your bank instead of the other bank in your city. All of a sudden you have nearly 500 loan applications to process this week!

Your manager sees this new influx as a great opportunity and wants you to figure out how to process all of these loan applications within one week.

Your task is to build a classification model and to systematically evaluate the creditworthiness of new loan applicants.
