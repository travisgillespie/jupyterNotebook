The important thing to note here is that both the training and the testing set of X were imputed using the mean of the entire X matrix. This is in direct violation of a core tenet of the machine learning procedure. We cannot assume that we know the mean of the entire dataset when predicting the test set's response values. Simply put, our KNN model is using information gained from the testing set to fit to the training set. This is a big red flag. These values will have to be imputed after the split.
