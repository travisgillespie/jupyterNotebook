# Project Overview

This project allowed me to run an A/B test on a factitious e-commerce website to understand if the company should implement their new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer before making a decision. I analyzed the <i>ab_data.csv</i> and _countries.csv_ datasets using Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy.
