Obviously not, this would be a foolish business model.\n",

Another  simple solution to cleaning up the dataset by removing rows that contain a negative number in the price column. As shown earler in the dataframe labaeled _df_predictedNegativePrices_, there are 291 rows that contain a negative price that could potentially be dropped from the dataset, or better yet, use these items to improve the algorithm. \n",
